# ChatDFT 
Created for TreeHacks 2023 

Inspired by "Is GPT-3 all you need for low-data discovery in chemistry?" 

ChatDFT = Chat (ChatGPT) + DFT (Density Functional Theory. It isn't featured in this project but it is a computational chemistry technique and it fits better than ChatChemClassification. Too wordy.)
